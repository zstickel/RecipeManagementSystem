This is the *Recipe Management System* project I made myself.


<p>An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Let's make a program that stores all recipes in one place. Get to know the backend development and use Spring Boot to complete this project. Learn about JSON, REST API, Spring Boot Security, H2 database, LocalDateTime, Project Lombok, and other concepts useful for your backend career.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/180?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/180</a>
